## User Stories

### As a User, I want...
MVP:
- a good user interface with clear direction and flow of pages so I understand where to go
- clear understanding of what the site is about so I know why I would want to do it and what I would get out of it
- a fun/game-like feel to the site so I won't leave immediately
- to see my results compared to my peers' and see where the headlines come from so I can pay attention to the language used
- to know about the people who made the app to satisfy my curiosity
- to be able to leave feedback
Stretch:
- to see my feedback displayed on the site

### As a Developer, I want...
MVP:
- to display article headlines for users to vote on and take user input to be the base of the game
- use Chart.js to aesthetically display user data compared with accumulated peer data so there is a reference point
- to display the headline with the source OR a preview of the article on the site so that users can draw connections between the language and the bias
- to direct users to a page that lets them learn about the site and the creators
- to allow users to leave comments about the site so they can be heard
- to provide an aesthetically pleasing landing page that incudes the name of the game, a play button
- to use a news API that lets me get data about current news, including at a minimum a headline, source, and link to the article
- to use normalized tables in my database in order to keep it all organized and unduplicated
- make news and politics more digestible by avoiding being overly heavy in tone or design
Stretch:
- to display comments and animate them
