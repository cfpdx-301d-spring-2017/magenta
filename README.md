## Project Pitch
The current political climate is very divided, with stratification of political idealogies becoming commonplace. Often busy users will see only headlines, or otherwise brief summaries of the news, and more specifically from their own news buble, rather than complete, well-balanced stories.

We want to open up a dialogue between opposing sides, bridging the divide between left and right news bubbles. By encouraging users to focus on the language in headlines, we want them to reflect on the political bias inherent in many news sources, as well as on their own internal biases.

Some questions that drive us:
- How do we open up a dialogue?
- How are different news headlines perceived?
- How does the media's language affect our stance on current political issues?

## User Stories

### As a User, I want...
MVP:
- a good user interface with clear direction and flow of pages so I understand where to go
- clear understanding of what the site is about so I know why I would want to do it and what I would get out of it
- a fun/game-like feel to the site so I won't leave immediately
- to see my results compared to my peers' and see where the headlines come from so I can pay attention to the language used
- to know about the people who made the app to satisfy my curiosity
- to be able to leave feedback

Stretch:
- to see my feedback displayed on the site

### As a Developer, I want...
MVP:
- to display article headlines for users to vote on and take user input to be the base of the game
- use Chart.js to aesthetically display user data compared with accumulated peer data so there is a reference point
- to display the headline with the source OR a preview of the article on the site so that users can draw connections between the language and the bias
- to direct users to a page that lets them learn about the site and the creators
- to allow users to leave comments about the site so they can be heard
- to provide an aesthetically pleasing landing page that incudes the name of the game, a play button
- to use a news API that lets me get data about current news, including at a minimum a headline, source, and link to the article
- to use normalized tables in my database in order to keep it all organized and unduplicated
- make news and politics more digestible by avoiding being overly heavy in tone or design

Stretch:
- to display comments and animate them
